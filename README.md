# UFOs
JavaScript table and HTML web page.
## Overview:
### Dynamic webpage has been created with a table that can be filtered for multiple criteria, which can provide a more refined analysis of UFO sightings.
## Results: 
### Searches can be refined by filtering multiple criteria which will be reflected on the table that appears on the UFO website. 
•	The filters on this website can be used by typing in search criteria into one of the filter boxes, as per example:

### Enter a Shape: “triangle” 
<img width="938" alt="shape" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74624855/133012959-6dc75935-69bd-48fe-a5ad-521ed98f30eb.png">

•	This can be filtered further by choosing a specific State (in this example, “ca” for “California.”
### Enter a State: “ca” 
<img width="941" alt="state" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74624855/133012970-139134d5-c038-491c-89b4-d03501a61808.png">

### Enter a City: “pasadena”
<img width="937" alt="city" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74624855/133012976-99f39d82-0595-44bb-86a3-9bb69346ddc6.png">

•	To clear the searches and reset the table, clear the search box(es) and press enter.

## Summary:
The results of the new site design with multiple filters, is that the code does not correct for case-errors. This can be corrected by applying code within the JavaScript file to make it so the filter boxes filter for any case, and also filter as the text is input, so if someone is typing in California, the filter will catch the “ca” at the beginning of the world and filter down.
